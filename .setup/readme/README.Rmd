## Description

Research compendium for the manuscript Pesigan, I. J. A., Russell, M. A., Chow, S.-M. (Under Review). Common and Unique Latent Transition Analysis (CULTA) as a Way to Examine the Trait-State Dynamics of Alcohol Intoxication. https://doi.org/10.0000/0000000000.

## Acknowledgments

This research was made possible by the Prevention and Methodology Training Program (PAMT) funded by a T32 training grant (T32 DA017629 MPIs: J. Maggs & S. Lanza) from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).

Computations for this research were performed on the Pennsylvania State University's Institute for Computational and Data Sciences' Roar supercomputer using SLURM for job scheduling (Yoo et al., 2003), GNU Parallel to run the simulations in parallel (Tange, 2021), and Apptainer to ensure a reproducible software stack (Kurtzer et al., 2017, 2021). See `.sim/README.md` and the scripts in the `.sim` folder in the [GitHub](https://github.com/jeksterslab/manCTMed) repository for more details on how the simulations were performed.
